We finally did it! 
Me and my 2 other Pig brothers had finally graduated Pig University and it was time to move out of our parents house and into the real world to hopefully begin our careers as Software Developers at Quicken Loans.  
The three of us decided to live together and wanted to build our own house so natually, we had a meeting to decide what kind of material we should use to build our house.

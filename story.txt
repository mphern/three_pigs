We finally did it! 
Me and my 2 other Pig brothers had finally graduated Pig University and it was time to move out of our parents house and into the real world to hopefully begin our careers as Software Developers at Quicken Loans.  
The three of us decided to live together and wanted to build our own house so natually, we had a meeting to decide what kind of material we should use to build our house.

So we all got together and started throwing out idea of what our house should be made of.  
Unfortunately, we just could not decide what to use to build our house.
One of my brothers wanted to use straw, another (for some reason) wanted to use brick.
I myself wanted to use sticks.
So we all decided that instead of living together, we would build our own houses with our favorite material of choice.

Once upon a time, my know-it-all brother was building his house. He was busy all
morning and afternoon, sweating his pig butt off laying bricks and scraping 
mortar. My other brother and I were busy making a delicious deep dish pizza for 
lunch. "Brothers," he called out to us in between finishing walls, "don't waste
your time lollygagging about! That big bad wolf is going to be here before you 
know it, and you won't be able to hide from him!" What an annoying goody two-
shoes, always trying to ruin my fun. He didn't even stop to eat the lunch we 
made!

After eating a few slices, my fun brother and I decided to lay in the field and
relax, letting our bodies digest all that pizza. In that beautiful summer
weather, feeling the warm sun on my face and the gentle breeze of the straw
brushing against me, I must have dozed off. I don't know how long I was out for,
but when I came to, I heard my brother's grating high-pitched squeal. "Eek!
Brothers! Quickly! That big bad wolf! He's coming! I see him! Run!" Acting fast,
I grabbed as much straw as I could carry and ran off. I needed a house. Quick.

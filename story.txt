We finally did it! 
Me and my 2 other Pig brothers had finally graduated Pig University and it was time to move out of our parents house and into the real world to hopefully begin our careers as Software Developers at Quicken Loans.  
The three of us decided to live together and wanted to build our own house so natually, we had a meeting to decide what kind of material we should use to build our house.

So we all got together and started throwing out idea of what our house should be made of.  
Unfortunately, we just could not decide what to use to build our house.
One of my brothers wanted to use straw, another (for some reason) wanted to use brick.
I myself wanted to use sticks.
So we all decided that instead of living together, we would build our own houses with our favorite material of choice.
